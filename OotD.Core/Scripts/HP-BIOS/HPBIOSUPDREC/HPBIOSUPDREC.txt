HP BIOS Update and Recovery

The purpose of the HP System BIOS Update and Recovery Utility is to provide a method
for users to flash the system BIOS from within the Windows OS environment.


NOTES:
     1. [Path]\HPBIOSUPDREC -? will display the available options for this utility.
     
     2. If the system has a F10-Setup password enabled, then HPBIOSUPDREC will prompt
	 for the password to be entered before completing the flash process.

USAGE:
  
     1.	Close all other applications before launching HPBIOSUPDREC.

     2. Open the folder containing the application and BIOS binary file.  Double-click
        on the HPBIOSUPDREC icon. 

     3. HPBIOSUPDREC will inform the user that a BIOS flash is about to occur.

     4. The version of the BIOS image in the binary file and the version of the 
        current system BIOS are displayed. Once OK is selected the system will restart 
        to begin the flash process.

     5.	Upon completion, the user is notified that the BIOS Flash was 
        successful.  Select Restart.

     6.	On restart, you may see the BIOS performing the final update, and the system
        may reset several times before loading the operating system.
