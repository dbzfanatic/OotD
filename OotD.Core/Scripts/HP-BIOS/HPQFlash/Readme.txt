               individual PCs using the Microsoft Windows operating system.

HPQ Password Utility - A utility to create an encrypted password file which
               can be used with the /p option of the HPQFlash application.
               This option is typically used along with the /s option to 
               perform a silent mode update of the system BIOS on HP systems
               which have a BIOS Setup password set.
               See HPQPswd.txt

The BIOS update process can also be done from a USB flash media device by 
copying the files from this folder to the USB drive and executing HPQFlash.exe 
from the device in Microsoft Windows.
